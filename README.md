Midnight Project

This is a website which will allow the user to explore different tracks based on the genre that they would prefer. The original idea came from the fact that when making games or projectst hat require music it is really hard to find the right track to match the vibes of the project and the search is usually really long. I made this webite to cut down on the search time. This website can also come in handy for those who want to upgrade their playlist. There are a total of 6 genres (I did 2 for the sake of repetition). In each genre you have the option of looking at instrumental or vocal music and under each category there should be 6 groups.

I made this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used AI to figure out the code behind the sample tracks and the Preious Page button since I user fake page transitions from the music pages to the individual group within the genre and type.
